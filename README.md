## The Process On Different Software
- In Excel: Corrected columns data types, replaced certain null values with the term unknown, replaced certain other values accordingly too, added a few columns more, cleaned the datasets off duplicates/blank rows/errors, and merged a few queries on Power Query.

- In SQL: Loaded the cleaned datasets from above and written queries to find the project KPIs.

- üì¶ Opportunity Types: A few specific opportunity types control the expected revenue.
- üè≠ Industry Focus: A few industries are driving the most deals, indicating more expansion.
- üåç Geographic Spread: Key countries are driving the expected revenue.
- üìà Forecast Vs Expected Revenues: Forecast and expected revenues peaked from 2020 to 2021 but then dropped, indicating potential over forecast or less opportunity creation.
- üü¢ Total Vs Active Opportunities: Total and active deals peaked from 2019 to 2021 but then dropped, indicating pipeline shortcomings.
- üìä Total Vs Closed Won Opportunities: Total and won deals dropped after 2021 with fewer to no wins, indicating sales execution gaps.
- üéØ Total Closed Vs Closed Won Opportunities: Total closed and won deals dropped after 2020 with fewer to no wins, indicating sales execution gaps again.
